## ***1. Introduction to Deployment Diagrams***
---
Deployment diagrams are **structural UML diagrams that model the physical architecture of a system.** 

They are primarily used for **system architecture decisions** and show how software components are distributed across hardware infrastructure.

#### **Primary Purpose**

- **Visualise system architecture and infrastructure requirements**
- **Define deployment strategies and configuration** needs
- Show relationships between hardware and **software** components
- **Guide infrastructure setup and deployment** processes


#### **When to Use**

- Planning system architecture at project start
- Documenting existing system infrastructure
- Communicating deployment requirements to operations teams
- Designing scalable and distributed systems

---

## ***2. Core Elements Overview***
---
Deployment diagrams consist of **SIX** fundamental elements that work together to represent system architecture:

![large](./07-175_IMG0.png)

- **Nodes**: Physical or logical hardware/software units
- **Components**: Software applications or services running on nodes
- **Artifacts**: Deployable software elements with specific configurations
- **Links**: Basic connections between nodes
- **Dependencies**: Directional relationships showing dependencies
- **Associations**: Complex relationships in distributed systems

---


## ***1.      Nodes***
---

### **Definition** 

>  Nodes represent **the fundamental building blocks** of deployment diagrams - they are **the actual real-world components where software runs**.


### **Visual Representation**

![large](./07-175_IMG1.png)

Three-dimensional boxes or cubes representing physical or logical deployment targets


### **Types of Nodes**

- **Physical Servers**: Web servers, database servers, application servers
- **Virtual Machines**: Cloud instances, containers
- **Databases**: Database management systems
- **APIs**: Service endpoints
- **Network Devices**: Load balancers, routers, firewalls


### **Key Principle** 

> **Everything in a deployment diagram is essentially a node**. All other elements either add detail to nodes or show relationships between them.


#### **Examples**

- Web Server hosting a React/Angular frontend
- Database Server running MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- API Gateway managing service requests
- Load Balanser distributing traffic

---


## ***2.      Components***
---

### **Definition**:

> **Software applications, services, or logical units that run within nodes** and handle business logic and communication.

![large](07-175_IMG3.png)



### **Visual Representation**
![large](./07-175_IMG2.png)

Rounded rectangles contained within nodes, often with component stereotypes


### **Component Types**

- **Web Applications**: Front-end applications (Angular, React, Vue)
- **Web Services**: Back-end services and APIs
- **Database Systems**: Database management software
- **Middlewares**: Message queues, caching systems
- **Business Logic Services**: Domain-specific applications


### **Alternative Syntax**

Different UML tools may represent components with varying visual styles:

- **Standard Style**: Rounded rectangles with component labels
- **Enterprise Architect Style**: Rectangular boxes with component stereotypes
- **Simplified Style**: Text labels within nodes



### **Design Philosophy**

> **The specific visual representation is less important than clearly communicating the software components** and their organisation. 

##### Choose the style that best serves your stakeholders and documentation needs.

---


## ***3.      Artifacts***
---

### **Definition**

**Specific "deployable" software elements** that provide detailed configuration and deployment information.


#### **Visual Representation**

Text surrounded by angle brackets (e.g., `<<device>>`, `<<angular web service>>`)

![large](./07-175_IMG4.png)



### **Purpose**

Artifacts tell architects and operations teams exactly **what needs to be installed, configured, and deployed** on each node.



### **Artifact Information Types**

- **Software Stack Requirements**: Framework and runtime specifications
- **Operating System Details**: OS type and version requirements
- **Configuration Parameters**: Environment-specific settings
- **Interface Specifications**: Communication protocols and ports


#### **Examples**

- `<<device:webServer Interface {OS=Linux}>>`
- `<<angular web service>>`
- `<<Rails API {version=7.0, database=PostgreSQL}>>`



### **Practical Value Example**

#### 1. When an artifact specifies "angular web service" ....
#### 2. .... operations teams know to install Node.js, NPM, and Angular dependencies. 

#### 1. If it specifies "Rails web service,".... 
#### 2. .... they know to prepare Ruby, Rails, and associated dependencies.


### **Formal Naming Convention**

UML standard format includes **device type, interface specification, and configuration parameters in a structured forma**t for precise deployment instructions.

---


## ***4.      Links***
---

### **Definition**

Basic connections between nodes showing that communication occurs between system components.

### **Visual Representation**

Simple lines connecting nodes without directional information

![large](07-175_IMG5.png)

### **Purpose**

- **Show which nodes can communicate with each other**
- Indicate network connectivity requirements
- Visualise basic system topology


### **Connection Examples**

- Angular front-end linked to Authentication system
- Front-end linked to Rails API
- API linked to Authentication system


### **Use Case**

> **Links provide a high-level view of system connectivity without specifying the nature or direction of dependencies.**

---


## ***5.      Dependencies***
---

### **Definition**
Directional relationships that specify which nodes depend on others for functionality.


### **Visual Representation**

Dotted lines with arrows pointing toward the nodes being depended upon

![large](07-175_IMG6.png)


### **Purpose**

- **Show explicit dependency relationships**
- Indicate deployment **order requirements**
- **Clarify** service dependencies for troubleshooting
- **Guide system startup and shutdown sequences**


### **Dependency Analysis Benefits**

- **Quick Assessment**: At a glance, understand which components rely on others
- **Deployment Planning**: Dependencies indicate which services must be started first
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand which components are affected if a dependency fails


### **Example Pattern**

- Angular frontend depends on Authentication system (arrow points to Auth)
- Angular frontend depends on Rails API (arrow points to API)
- Rails API depends on Authentication system (arrow points to Auth)

---


## ***6.      Associations***
---

### **Definition**

Complex relationships in distributed systems that show how multiple nodes work together in sophisticated architectures.


### **Visual Representation**

Lines connecting multiple nodes, often in hub-and-spoke or network patterns

![large](07-175_IMG7.png)


### **Use Cases**

- **Load Balancer Architectures**: Show how load balancers distribute requests to multiple application servers
- **Microservice Communication**: Model complex service-to-service communication patterns
- **Database Clustering**: Represent database replication and clustering relationships
- **CDN Networks**: Show content distribution and caching relationships


###  **Example Architecture**:  

A load balancer receiving requests from the Internet and mapping them to various application servers, which then communicate with database clusters.


### **Deployment Strategy Insights**

Association patterns provide a "recipe" for infrastructure setup, showing:

- Number of application servers needed
- Database clustering requirements
- Load balancer configuration needs
- Network topology requirements

## 3.      Design Principles and Best Practices***
---
### Clarity Over Perfection

- Focus on clear communication rather than perfect UML notation
- Choose visual styles that make sense to your stakeholders
- Prioritize understanding over strict symbol adherence

### Architecture-First Approach

- Use deployment diagrams early in project planning
- Let infrastructure requirements drive technology choices
- Consider scalability and maintenance from the start

### Stakeholder Communication

- Ensure diagrams serve both technical and business audiences
- Include enough detail for implementation without overwhelming
- Use consistent notation across project documentation

### Deployment Recipe Mentality

- Design diagrams that serve as deployment guides
- Include configuration details in artifacts
- Show dependencies clearly for proper deployment sequencing

### Tool Flexibility

- Accept that different UML tools may have varying visual representations
- Focus on content accuracy rather than visual consistency across tools
- Document any tool-specific notation choices for team clarity
