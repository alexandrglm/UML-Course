## Welcome to this **Problem Solving course**! 

> Originally **made from Bottega's DevCamp**, but rearmed as my own UML Course essentials, where we're going to get as high as possible **UML knowledge**  anb leverage **systems analysis/design** in order to take a practical approach at solving complex software problems.

## 07-187:  The Importance of System Analysis and Design for Solving Real World (software) problems

The main goal of this UML course is not (only) about being able to name what kind of diagrams are available either the best approach of each kind of them.

## Main goal:  Analytical Problem-Solving mindset

* Going **beyond the idea of just following along** and building something based off of a tutorial, instead ...
* .... by helping to develop a **mindset for problem-solving**
* Taking a very analytical approach to build complex systems.

### The Gap Between Following and Creating

#### **What as a student I can learn:**

- ✅ Programming syntax
- ✅ Following guided tutorials
- ✅ Building predetermined applications

#### **What as a student I really struggle with:**

- ❌ Approaching new, undefined problems
- ❌ Designing systems from scratch
- ❌ Analytical problem-solving mindset

---
### Course Philosophy:        Think First, Code Later


Even though we're going to be learning how to solve complex problems, **we're not going to care about the programming language**.

>    **Common Issue as a Junior Developer**:
  Less start the action, and more analysing and designing before starting to prototype.

## The "Code-First" Conundrum

As an early developer I am, especially early in their careers, I tend to jump straight into coding. This "code-first" instinct can lead to:

1. **Immediate project initiation** 💻, what sounds Amazing but, then ...

2. **Mid-project realisation** that the foundational structure needs to be different 😵

3. Finally, **Extensive refactoring** or even complete rewrites 🔄

---

##  Design-First Methodology

A design-first approach offers a powerful alternative, allowing to:

1. **Configure data structures** before writing any code 📊
2. **Leverage behaviour-based diagrams** to customise and design the user experience 🎯
3. **Plan the implementation details** thoroughly before touching the keyboard 📋

---

## Learning Through Design: A Step-by-Step Process

This course's structure is built around reinforcing this design-first principle:

### Project Workflow

For each project, the process is clear and iterative:

1. **📝 Project Brief:** A clear outline of what needs to be built is provided.

2. **🎨 Design Phase:** This is where the core learning happens. The focus is entirely on **designing the systems** and building a comprehensive plan. **No coding is involved at this stage.**

3. **🔍 Solution Review:** After creating the required diagrams, solutions are reviewed to see alternative design approaches.

---

## Why a Design-First Approach Is Crucial

---
### Impact on Your Career

**Problem-solving is a highly sought-after skill** by hiring managers. 

When mastering a design-first approach, you're not just writing code; you're becoming an expert problem-solver.

---
### Professional Advantages

Building a well-architected system means addressing issues at the design stage, leading to significant benefits:

- 🎯 **Better Architecture:** Well-planned systems are inherently more robust and scalable.  

- ⚡ **Faster and Better Implementation:** A clear plan streamlines the coding process, making it more efficient.

- 🐛 **Fewer Bugs:** Design allows for identifying and resolving potential issues before they become embedded in the code.

- 💰 **Cost-Effective:** Minimising refactoring and rework saves valuable time and resources.

---

## The Power of Planning

The core principle here is that **better planning leads to easier implementation**.

### The Development Equation

```
Better Planning = Easier Implementation
```

By dedicating time to properly design a system, the actual coding becomes much more straightforward and efficient.

## So ... What are the next Steps?

Remember:

#### 1. UML foundations & Software Analysis
#### 2. UML Structures
#### 3. UML Kind of diagrams
